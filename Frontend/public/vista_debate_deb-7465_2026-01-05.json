    "agent": "Critic Agent",
    "position": "Device binding for recurring payments is impractical. Subscription renewals happen without user device interaction. Need server-to-server token validation.",
    "reasoning": [
      "Recurring payments are initiated by merchant, not customer device",
      "Device binding would break auto-renewal flows",
      "Industry practice allows merchant-initiated transactions with different token type"
