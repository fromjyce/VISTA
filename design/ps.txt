Problem Statement 4: Agentic AI-Enabled Continuous  PCI/PII Compliance for 
Financial Services Organizations 
Track: RegTech, FinTech, Agentic AI, Generative AI, Risk & Compliance Automation 
Objective: 
Create an agentic AI-powered compliance platform built on autonomous, agent-
based systems that can make decisions, plan tasks, and operate independently using 
tools and data, without constant human supervision. The platform should pursue long-
term compliance goals, break down complex regulatory objectives into manageable 
steps, access multiple data sources, and adapt its behavior based on real-time 
regulatory updates and operational feedback. 
Description: 
Financial services organizations operate in a dynamic regulatory environment where 
requirements evolve rapidly across jurisdictions. Traditional compliance programs—
largely manual and reactive—struggle to scale with regulatory volume, operational 
complexity, and the pace of change. 
This challenge invites participants to use Agentic AI to transform compliance operations 
by: 
1. Enabling autonomous regulatory (GDPR, CCPA, LGPD etc) interpretation, policy 
mapping, and gap detection. 
2. Deploying agent-based systems capable of monitoring large data flows—
including transactions, customer communications, and internal documents—in 
real time. 
3. Allowing natural language interaction with regulations, policies, and compliance 
findings. 
4. Generating dynamic risk dashboards, remediation plans, and audit ready 
evidence packages with minimal human intervention. 
 
Tasks: 
1. Regulatory Discovery and Interpretation: 
• Identify publicly available regulatory updates, rulebooks, and supervisory 
guidance across finance, conduct, AML, and data privacy domains. 
• Analyze document structures, obligations, definitions, and required controls. 
• Configure agents capable of autonomously scanning, parsing, and summarizing 
regulatory changes. 
2. Agentic Compliance Processing Strategy: 
• Design an approach using autonomous agents, RAG pipelines, AI orchestration 
layers, and large language models. 
• Equip agents to interpret regulations, map them to internal policies, and identify 
conflicting or outdated controls. 
• Ensure that agents can independently operate tools (e.g., search APIs, 
document repositories, workflow systems) to perform multi-step reasoning and 
planning. 
3. Continuous Monitoring, Insights, and Risk Detection: 
• Deploy agents to monitor transactional data, marketing content, 
communications, and operational logs in real time. 
• Generate proactive alerts, anomaly detections, compliance risk heatmaps, and 
predictive behavioral insights. 
• Enable cross analysis across multiple regulatory domains to identify systemic 
risks or overlapping obligations. 
4. Interactive, Autonomous Compliance Assurance Platform: 
• Build an intelligent compliance assistant that allows SMEs, auditors, and 
regulators to query compliance findings in natural language. 
• Create dynamic, AI-generated dashboards that visualize compliance posture, 
regulatory mappings, agent-driven tasks, and remediation progress. 
• Ensure agents can autonomously create evidence packages, update control 
libraries, and recommend corrective actions—adapting behavior based on real-
time environmental feedback.
