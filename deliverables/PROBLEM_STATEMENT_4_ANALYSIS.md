- **Gap**: Most tools designed for periodic assessments
- **Impact**: Compliance decay between audits

#### 3. Siloed Compliance Functions
- **Problem**: PCI, GDPR, AML, KYC handled separately
- **Gap**: No unified compliance view
- **Impact**: Duplicated effort, conflicting controls

#### 4. Reactive vs. Proactive
- **Problem**: Regulations change every 7 minutes
- **Gap**: Manual regulatory tracking
- **Impact**: Always playing catch-up

#### 5. Human Bottleneck
- **Problem**: 42% of C-suite time on compliance
- **Gap**: Tools require extensive human configuration
- **Impact**: Scalability ceiling

#### 6. Explainability Deficit
- **Problem**: Auditors need clear reasoning
