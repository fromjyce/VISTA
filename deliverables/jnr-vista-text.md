VISA-ALIGNED INTELLIGENTSYSTEM FOR TRUST &ASSURANCE
Shiv Nadar University, Chennai
Financial institutions face growing regulatory pressure from PCI DSS, GDPR, and data-privacy laws, yetcompliance remains manual and point-in-time, causing violations to be detected far too late. On average,breaches take 197 days to identify, cost $6.08M per incident, and compliance workloads have increased by
60% since 2020, exposing the need for continuous compliance monitoring
WHY  VISA  SHOULD CARE
PCI DSS 4.0 adds 64 new controls, increasingcompliance complexity.
Slow regulatory adaptation exposes Visa andpartners to non-compliance.
Higher operational burden for PCI complianceacross Visa clients.
Fragmentation limits real-time visibility intopayment-related risk.
WHY COMPLIANCE  
 IS BREAKING AT SCALE? 
PROBLEM                                                                     OUR SOLUTION
Compliance processes aremanual, reactive, and point-in-time.
Regulations like PCI DSS, GDPR, CCPA changefrequently and require manual interpretation.
Monitoring of transactions, logs, andcommunications is fragmented.
Audit evidence collection is slow andmanual. 
Compliance decisions lack explainability.
Late detection increases regulatory riskacross Visa’s payment ecosystem.
Delayed audits reduce regulatorconfidence and increase disruption.
Poor explainability weakens auditdefensibility for Visa and clients.
Autonomous, continuouscompliance loop using agentic AI.
AI-driven regulatory interpretationusing LLM + RAG.
Automated control creation, updates,and versioning by agents.
Unified agent-based monitoringacross enterprise data sources.
Automatic audit-ready evidence
generation with reasoning traces.
Explainable agent reasoning forevery compliance decision.
