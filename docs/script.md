Perfect — this is a **finals-level request**, and you’re absolutely right to focus on **delivery**, not slides.

Below is a **full 10-minute pitch script** (8 mins talk + 2 mins demo),
**split across J, N, R**, **story-driven**, and **NOT reading from slides**.

I’ve aligned this **exactly to your final PPT (`Vista (2)`)** and to how **Visa judges listen**.

# 🟦 J — OPENING & STORY (3.5 mins)

### Slide 1–2: Opening (Storytelling, NOT reading)

> “Let me start with a simple question.”

> “If a regulator walked in **right now** and asked —
> *‘Are you compliant?’*
> Most organizations would say… *‘Let’s check.’*”

> “And that’s the problem.”

> “Compliance today is still **manual, audit-driven, and point-in-time**,
> even though regulations like **PCI DSS 4.0** and data-privacy laws **change continuously**.”

> “Violations don’t appear during audits — they appear **months later**, after the damage is already done.”

Pause. Look at judges.

> “So the real question isn’t
> *‘Are we compliant during audits?’*
> It’s —
> **‘Are we compliant right now?’**”

---

### Slide 3–4: What VISTA Is (Vision)

> “That’s why we built **VISTA** —
> a **Visa-aligned intelligent system for trust and assurance**.”

> “VISTA is not another dashboard.
> It’s not a rule engine.
> And it’s not a chatbot.”

> “VISTA is a **continuous, autonomous, and explainable compliance system** that understands regulations, monitors enterprise data, and produces audit-ready evidence — **all the time**.”

> “Our mission is simple:
> Turn compliance from a **reactive obligation** into a **living trust system** for Visa’s ecosystem.”

---

### Slide 5–6: The Trust Gap (Problem Framing)

> “Today, Visa and its partners face three core problems.”

> “First — **regulatory velocity**.
> PCI DSS 4.0, regional mandates, privacy laws — they evolve faster than humans can track.”

> “Second — **fragmented monitoring**.
> Compliance signals are spread across logs, databases, and teams.”

> “Third — **weak explainability**.
> Even when violations are found, it’s hard to explain *why* — especially to regulators.”

> “These gaps don’t just affect one bank — they create **systemic risk** across the Visa network.”

---

### Slide 7: Transition to System

> “So we asked ourselves —
> What if compliance behaved like a **system**, not a checklist?”

> “That’s what VISTA does.”

> “Let me briefly show you **how it’s built**.”

---

### Slide 6–7: Architecture (High Level)

> “At a high level, VISTA has four layers.”

> “A **frontend** for real-time visibility and regulatory queries.”

> “An **agentic AI backend** that thinks and acts autonomously.”

> “A **compliance services layer** that handles detection, explainability, and evidence.”

> “And a **regulatory intelligence layer** using AI to interpret evolving regulations.”

> “This architecture gives us **end-to-end traceability** —
> from regulation → control → detection → evidence.”

> “Now, the key part is not the architecture —
> it’s how the system **thinks**.”

Hand off to **N**.

# 🟦 N — AGENTIC AI (2.5 mins)

### Slide 7: Autonomous Agents in Motion

> “VISTA works through **agentic AI** — meaning the system doesn’t wait for humans to trigger it.”

> “We use four autonomous agents.”

> “The **Regulatory Watcher Agent** continuously tracks regulatory updates — like PCI or RBI changes.”

> “The **Interpreter Agent** reads those regulations, debates interpretations internally, and converts them into enforceable controls.”

> “The **Monitor Agent** continuously scans enterprise data — logs, databases, files — for violations.”

> “And the **Remediator Agent** doesn’t just flag issues —
> it documents, schedules remediation, and generates evidence.”

---

### Explain Why This Matters

> “This is important because most compliance tools stop at detection.”

> “VISTA goes further — it **reasons**, **acts**, and **explains**.”

> “Every decision has:

* the regulation it came from,
* the control it violated,
* the agent that made the decision,
* and the reasoning behind it.”

> “That’s what makes the system **auditable and regulator-ready**.”

---

### Slide 8–9: Proof in Action (Setup Demo Context)

> “So what does this look like in practice?”

> “Instead of static reports, VISTA continuously generates:

* compliance findings,
* AI response cards,
* and executive-ready evidence packages.”

> “Let’s quickly show this in action.”

Hand over to **Demo**.

---

# 🟦 DEMO (2 mins)

*(Keep this fast — no explanations, only outcomes)*

1️⃣ **Dashboard**

> “This shows live compliance posture — not last month’s audit.”

2️⃣ **Regulatory Watcher**

> “Here, a regulation update is detected and interpreted automatically.”

3️⃣ **Violation & XAI**

> “This violation is flagged, explained, and mapped to a control.”

4️⃣ **Evidence Export**

> “And this evidence package is audit-ready — right now.”

> “No manual effort. No waiting for audits.”

---

# 🟦 R — RISKS, IMPACT & FUTURE (2 mins)

### Slide 11: What Could Go Wrong

> “Autonomy without trust is dangerous — so we designed safeguards.”

> “High-risk actions are **human-gated and reversible**.”

> “We store **derived metadata only**, not raw PAN or PII.”

> “Every action is **encrypted, time-stamped, and explainable**.”

> “So VISTA balances automation with accountability.”

---

### Slide 12–13: Impact & Beyond

> “The impact is tangible.”

> “Violations move from **audit-time to real-time**.”

> “Evidence moves from **weeks of preparation to always-on**.”

> “Compliance shifts from **reactive to proactive**.”

> “For Visa, this means **network-level trust and reduced systemic risk**.”

> “And going forward, VISTA can enable:

* network-wide PCI risk scoring,
* regulator-facing evidence APIs,
* and multi-region compliance intelligence.”

---

### Final Closing (Slide 14)

> “To conclude —”

> “VISTA doesn’t replace audits.”

> “It makes compliance **continuously provable**.”

> “Because at Visa scale,
> **trust cannot be periodic.**”

> **“It has to be continuous.”**
